#Understanding and Working with Permission Groups


Permission groups allow you to control who has access to [projects](../project/creating_a_project.md), [forms](../forms/creating_a_form.md), and [records](../records/creating_a_record.md). 

You are able to control access to your Kora project in two areas: **project permissions** and **form permissions**. 

##Project Permission Groups

At the project level, you can add and remove users to the project admin group and the project default group. You can also create a new permission group.

It is possible to remove users from a project. The removed Kora user will be notified via email. The email notification will include which project(s) they were removed from and who made the permissions change (name, username, and email).

###Project Admin Group
Users in the project **Admin Group** can create, edit, and delete forms. This gives the user full access to the project. 

###Project Default Group
You can select what permissions you would like users in the project **Default Group** to have. These options include: creating forms, edit forms, and deleting forms. You are able to select particular form permissions for users by checking the boxes next to the permissions located in permissions groups.

###Project New Permissions Group
If you are a Kora user with installation privileges, you are able to create new permission groups at the project level. 

You can create groups within a project that have specific permissions such as only the ability to create forms. Limiting the amount of project permissions granted to other users is useful in cases where you want to control access. You are able to select particular form permissions for users by checking the boxes next to the permissions located in permissions groups.


##Form Permission Groups
Adding a user to a form gives certain form permissions to [users already in your Kora organization](../user-accounts/managing_users_in_a_kora_installation.md). Form permissions allow users to create, edit, and delete fields as well as records, depending on the permissions given to them. 

[Users added as form administrators](../forms/additional_form_administrators) will automatically have all of these permissions, but Kora allows you to create different permission groups for different users. Limiting the amount of form permissions granted to other users is useful in cases where you only want users to be able to enter data and create records.

Users will *not* be notified when removed from a form permissions group.

###Form Admin Group
Form administrators are individuals that are able to modify a form, including the ability to create, edit, and delete both forms and records. 

###Form Default Group
You can select what permissions you would like users in the form **Default Group** to have. These options include: creating fields and records, editing fields and records, and deleting forms and records. You are able to select particular form permissions for users by checking the boxes next to the permissions located in permissions groups.

###Form New Permissions Group
You may also create new permission groups to further customize the types of permissions that form users use.
You are able to select particular form permissions for users by checking the boxes next to the permissions located in permissions groups. The options allow you to stop certain users from creating, editing, or deleting fields while still giving them the ability to create, edit, or delete records.
