# Viewing Your User Account

Every Kora user has a user account. Their user account contains profile information, permissions information and a record history that can be viewed by the users themselves and administrators. In order to view your user account information, follow these directions:

1. Click on the **Person Icon** at the top-right of the page in the navigation bar. <img style="display:block;margin:auto;max-width:100%" src="../user-accounts-img/viewing_your_user_account_1_annotated.png" title="Step 1">

2. Select **View My Profile** from the menu. <img style="display:block;margin:auto;max-width:100%" src="../user-accounts-img/viewing_your_user_account_2_annotated.png" title="Step 2">

This will bring you to your user account where you can view your profile information, permissions and record history.

## Profile information

A user's profile information will contain all of the information entered into their profile when [creating](../user-accounts/signing_up_for_a_user_account.md) and [editing](../user-accounts/edit_user_account.md) that account. This includes first name, last name, username, email, and organization.

## Permissions

The permissions section of your profile will display the [project](../user-accounts/view_your_project_permissions.md) and [form](../forms/adding_users_to_forms.md) permissions that you have been granted within a Kora installation. <p align="center"> <img src="../user-accounts-img/viewing_your_user_account_4_annotated.png" width="100%" style="align:center" title="Step 4"> </p>

## Record History
