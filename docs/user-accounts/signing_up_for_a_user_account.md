# Signing Up for a User account

After [being invited to a Kora installation by an administrator](../user-accounts/managing_users_in_a_kora_installation.md), you will be able to sign up for a user account. Follow these instructions to create a user account:

1. Accept the email invite from an administrator for the Kora installation. <p align="center"> <img src="../user-accounts-img/managing_users_in_a_kora_installation_1_annotated.png" width="100%" style="align:center" title="Step 1"> </p>

2. This will take you to a page to create a new Kora account. Fill in your information to create an account.<img style="display:block;margin:auto;max-width:100%" src="../user-accounts-img/managing_users_in_a_kora_installation_2_annotated.png" title="Step 2">

3. When you're finished entering your information click **Sign Up**. <img style="display:block;margin:auto;max-width:100%" src="../user-accounts-img/managing_users_in_a_kora_installation_3_annotated.png" title="Step 3">

4. This will open up a new page thanking you for signing up with Kora. Welcome by the way! We have sent you a new email which provides a final link for activating your account. Alternatively you may activate your account by entering the token which is also provided in the email. <p align="center"> <img src="../user-accounts-img/managing_users_in_a_kora_installation_4_annotated.png" width="100%" style="align:center" title="Step 4"> </p>

5. Once you've activated your account you'll be directed to a page welcoming you to Kora. If this is your first time using Kora, then we highly recommend going through our introduction. <p align="center"> <img src="../user-accounts-img/managing_users_in_a_kora_installation_5_annotated.png" width="100%" style="align:center" title="Step 5"> </p>

The introduction will walk you through [the basics of Kora](../getting-started/core_concepts.md), and end by asking you which [projects you would like permissions for](../projects/adding_users_to_projects.md).
