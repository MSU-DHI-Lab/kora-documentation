# Editing a Project

If you have the correct permissions to edit a project, then there are multiple ways to get to the page for editing its info. Once you navigate to the *Edit Project* page, you are able to change the name, description and permissions for the project. If you want to edit other parts of the project, you will have to go to the individual [form](../../forms/editing_a_form) or [record](../../records/editing_a_record) that you wish to edit.

## Navigating the *Edit Project* page

There are three options you can follow to navigate to the *Edit Project* page:

1. If you [made your project available on the dashboard](../accessing_and_managing_projects_from_the_dashboard) as a project block, then you are able to access the *Edit Project* page directly from here. Simply click on the **Edit Project Info** button at the bottom-left of the project block.

2. Another option is to navigate to your [project list page](../customizing_project_list_view). From this page you'll be able to select the **Edit Project Info** button at the bottom-left of each block containing your project.

3. Another option is to click on the **Edit Project Info** in the upper-right of the initial page view after opening a project.

4. The last option is available when you navigate to the project that you want to edit. Opening up either of the following menu pages will give you the option to click **Edit Project Info**.

## Editing a Project

After Navigating to the *Edit Project* page, you have the option to edit certain aspects of your project including your project's name, description and its permissions. You also have the option to [archive](../archiving_a_project) or [delete](../deleting_a_project) your project, though the specifics of those actions will not be discussed in this section. Follow these steps to edit the name, description and permissions of your project:

1. Navigate to the *Edit Project* page.

## Editing Project Permissions

Navigating to the *Project Permissions* page (Step 3 in the previous section, "[Editing a Project](#editing-a-project_1)"), you are able to manage the permissions that allow users to create, edit and/or delete forms in your project. You are able to select particular form permissions for users by checking the boxes next to the permissions located in permissions groups.

In order to add new users to a permission group follow these steps:

1. The **Admin Group** will be the first block in the *Project Permissions* page. These will likely be users who have full permissions to create, edit and delete forms. Below the admin block is the **Default Group** block where new users with new permissions can be added. Click on **Default Group** to open it up.

2. Once the block is open, click **Add New User(s) to Group** to add new users to this group.

3. A modal will appear prompting you to *Select User(s) to Add to Permissions Group*. Click on the **Search and Select Users to be Added to the Permission Group** drop-down list. Select the users you want added to this group from the list that appears below the box. You may also remove accidently-selected users by clicking on the **x** next to their name.
