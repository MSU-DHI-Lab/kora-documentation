# Deleting a Project

To delete a project you must first navigate to your *Edit Project* page. In order to get access to this page you must first have the correct administrative permissions to delete a project. If you have administrative permission, follow these steps to delete a project.

1. Navigate to the page for [editing your project info](../projects/editing_a_project.md). The **Edit Project Info** button is shown from the [dashboard](../projects/managing_projects_from_the_dashboard.md) in the image below. You are also able to reach the page to edit your project from your [list of your projects](../projects/customizing_project_list_view.md) or the navigation bar when in your project. <p align="center"> <img src="../projects-img/deleting_a_project_1_annotated.png" width="100%" style="align:center" title="Step 1"> </p>
