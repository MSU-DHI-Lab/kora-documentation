# Archiving a Project


Kora admins and project admins can archive projects. When you archive a project, you are removing it from your main list of active projects. Once archived, the project is listed in the **Archived** tab of the main project page. Archived projects can be easily un-archived.

## Archive a Project

To archive a project:

1. Navigate to the landing page for the project you'd like to archive. At the top of your project page, click the **edit button**. Alternatively, you can open the project's menu in the top menu bar and select **Edit Project Information**. This will bring you to the *Edit Project* page.

3. A modal will appear asking you to confirm if you would like to archive the project. Click the **Archive Project** button. This will move your project from your Projects list to the Archived Projects list.

## Unarchive a Project

To unarchive a project:

1. Navigate to your project landing page. Click on the **Archived** tab, located above the *Create New Project* button.

2. This will bring you to the tab listing all of your archived projects. Find the project you would like to *Unarchive* and click the **Unarchive** button located in the bottom right corner of the project card.

    This will automatically remove the project from the Archived list, and move it back to your *Custom* and *Alphabetical* active project lists. You will receive a pop-up notification in the top-right corner of your window informing you that your project was successfully unarchived.
