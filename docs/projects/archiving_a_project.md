#Archiving a Project


Kora admins and project admins can archive projects.  When you archive a project, you are removing it from your main list of active projects.  Onced archived, the project is listed in the **Archived** tab of the main project page.  Archived projects can be easily un-archived.  

To archive a project:

1. Navigate to the landing page for the project you'd like to archive. At the top of your project page, click the **edit button**.  Alternatively, you can open the project's menu in the top menu bar and select **Edit Project Information**. This will bring you to the *Edit Project* page. <p align="center"> <img src="../projects-img/archiving_a_project_1_annotated.png" width="100%" style="align:center" title="Step 1"> </p>  <p align="center"> <img src="../projects-img/archiving_a_project_2_annotated.png" width="100%" style="align:center" title="Step 1"> </p>
