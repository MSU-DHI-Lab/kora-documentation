#Exporting a Project

Kora admins and project admins can export Kora projects.  The export process generates a .kProj file which contains project structure and information (title, description) and forms (including all of the form structure).  The export process **does not** export the records themselves.  
To learn how to export records, visit the [Exporting a Record](../records/exporting_a_record.md) guide.

There is a couple of reasons why you might want to export your project.  The most notable is that it allows project portability.  You can export your porject and then import it into another Kora installation, thereby avoiding the need to build the structure of a project from scratch.  If you're interested in learning how to import a kora project, check out the [Importing a Project](../project/importing_a_project.md) guide.

To export a project:

1. Navigate to the project you'd like to export. 

2. Click the name of the project in the top menu bar to open the project's dropdown menu.

3. In the dropdown menu, select **Export Project**. This will automatically start downloading your project's .kProj export file.
