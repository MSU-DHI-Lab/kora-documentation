#Exporting a Project

Exporting a project allows you to save the project as a .kProj file onto your computer. Another benefit of exporting a project is that it allows you to import that project into Kora as a new project, so you can use the forms and fields already created.

Follow the steps below to export a project.

1. From the project you would like to export, click the name of the project in the top menu bar. This will open a dropdown menu.

2. In the dropdown, select the last option, **Export Project**. This will automatically start the download of the project onto your computer as a .kProj filetype.
