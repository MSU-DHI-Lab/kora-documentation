#Exporting a Project

Exporting a project allows you to save the project as a .kProj file onto your computer. Another benefit of exporting a project is that it allows you to import that project into Kora as a new project, so you can use the forms and fields already created. 

Follow the steps below to export a project.

1. From the project you would like to export, click the name of the project in the top menu bar. This will open a dropdown menu. <p align="center"> <img src="../projects-img/exporting_a_project_1_annotated.png" width="100%" style="align:center" title="Step 1"> </p>

2. In the dropdown, select the last option, **Export Project**. This will automatically start the download of the project onto your computer as a .kProj filetype. <p align="center"> <img src="../projects-img/exporting_a_project_2_annotated.png" width="100%" style="align:center" title="Step 2"> </p>
