# Customizing the Project List View

The projects list view refers to your view of projects from the *Projects* page. The *Projects* page displays all of the projects that you have access to in a list. This list of projects can then be organized alphabetically or in a customized view. A custom view allows you to place projects you more frequently use at the top of the page. You may also view [archived projects](../projects/archiving_a_project.md) from the *Projects* page.

## Editing Preferences for How Projects are Viewed

When you first navigate to your *Projects* page, you will always see your projects organized alphabetically from a-z unless you change the initial default view in your preferences. To change how you view your projects, go to [your preferences page](../user-accounts/edit_user_preferences.md) and perform the following actions:

* Scroll down to the section for *Projects Page Tab Selection*
* Select either a custom or alphabetical view of your projects. <p align="center"> <img src="../projects-img/customizing_project_list_view_1_annotated.png" width="100%" style="align:center" title="Step 1"> </p>

Don't confuse this process with the *Single Project Page Tab Selection* section, which changes the default view of forms within your projects.

## Alphabetical Project List View

In your *Projects* page, the alphabetical view will list your projects in order from a-z. After selecting another view, you can always go back to an alphabetical view by clicking **alphabetical** as shown below. <p align="center"> <img src="../projects-img/customizing_project_list_view_2_annotated.png" width="100%" style="align:center" title="Step 2"> </p>

## Custom Project List View

In your *Projects* page, it is also possible to customize the order in which your projects are viewed. Follow these steps to create a custom view of your projects:

1. Make sure that you are in the **Custom** option on your *Projects* page. <p align="center"> <img src="../projects-img/customizing_project_list_view_3_annotated.png" width="100%" style="align:center" title="Step 3"> </p>

2. You may shift the placement of projects in your list by selecting the **up arrow** or **down arrow** to the left of each project's name. <p align="center"> <img src="../projects-img/customizing_project_list_view_4_annotated.png" width="100%" style="align:center" title="Step 4"> </p>

3. Another option for moving projects is to click a project that you want to move and drag it to your desired location. <p align="center"> <img src="../projects-img/customizing_project_list_view_5_annotated.png" width="100%" style="align:center" title="Step 5"> </p>

4. Whenever you open up to your custom view in the *Projects* page, the projects will automatically be shown in the order you have sorted it into. <p align="center"> <img src="../projects-img/customizing_project_list_view_6_annotated.png" width="100%" style="align:center" title="Step 6"> </p>

## Archived Project List View

Another option is to view your [projects that have been archived](../projects/archiving_a_project.md). Simply click on the **Archived** option in your *Projects* page to view your archived projects. <p align="center"> <img src="../projects-img/customizing_project_list_view_7_annotated.png" width="100%" style="align:center" title="Step 7"> </p>
