#Importing a Project

To import a project, you need to have the .kProj file for the project you want to import.  The .kProj file is created during the [project export](../projects/exporting_a_project.md) process.  Its important to note that a .kProj file **only** contains the project's structure and information (title, description) and forms (including all of the form structure). The .kProj file does not include the project's records.  To learn how to export and import records, check out the [Exporting a Record](../records/exporting_a_record.md) and [Importing a Record](../records/importing_a_record.md) guides.  To learn how to import a **multi form record**, check out the [Importing a Multiform Record](../records/importing_multi_form_records.md) guide.  

To import a project, follow these steps:

1. From anywhere in Kora, click on the **Projects** option in the top menu bar.

5. After you've uploaded your .kProj file, click on the **Project Information** tab  In the *Project Information* section, you have the option to enter a project name and description, or you can leave these options blank to use the name and description from the original project.
