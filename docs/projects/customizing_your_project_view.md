# Customizing the View within a Project

When you are within an individual project, you can chose to have the forms within that project displayed alphabetically or in a custom order. This documentation outlines how to organize how the forms in your project are viewed.

## Editing Preferences for how Forms are Viewed in a Project

When you first navigate to the page for your project, you will always see an alphabetical view of your forms first unless you change the initial default view to custom. To change how you view your forms, go to [your preferences page](../user-accounts/edit_user_preferences.md) and do the following:

* Scroll down to the section for *Single Project Tab Selection* and select either a custom or alphabetical view of your projects. Don't confuse this with the *Projects Page Tab Selection* section, which changes how all of your projects are organized within the *Projects* page. <p align="center"> <img src="../projects-img/customizing_project_list_view_1_annotated.png" width="100%" style="align:center" title="Step 1"> </p>

## Alphabetical View

In the page for a single project, the alphabetical view will list your froms in order from a-z. After selecting another view, you can always go back to an alphabetical view by clicking **alphabetical** as shown below. <p align="center"> <img src="../projects-img/customizing_project_list_view_2_annotated.png" width="100%" style="align:center" title="Step 2"> </p>

## Custom View

It is also possible to customize the order in which your forms are viewed. Follow these steps to create a custom view of your forms.

1. Make sure that you are in the **Custom** option on your project's page. <p align="center"> <img src="../projects-img/customizing_project_list_view_3_annotated.png" width="100%" style="align:center" title="Step 3"> </p>

2. You may shift the placement of forms in your list by selecting the **up arrow** or **down arrow** to the left of each project's name. <p align="center"> <img src="../projects-img/customizing_project_list_view_4_annotated.png" width="100%" style="align:center" title="Step 4"> </p>

3. Another option for moving projects is to click a project that you want to move and drag it to your desired location. <p align="center"> <img src="../projects-img/customizing_project_list_view_5_annotated.png" width="100%" style="align:center" title="Step 5"> </p>

4. Whenever you open up to your custom view in the *Projects* page, the projects will automatically be shown in the order you have sorted it into. <p align="center"> <img src="../projects-img/customizing_project_list_view_6_annotated.png" width="100%" style="align:center" title="Step 6"> </p>
