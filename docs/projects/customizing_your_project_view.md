# Customizing the View within a Project

When you are within an individual project, you can chose to have the forms within that project displayed either alphabetically, or in a custom order. This documentation outlines how to organize the view of your project's forms.

## Editing Preferences for how Forms are Viewed in a Project

When you first navigate to the page for your project, your forms will default to being listed in alphabetical order. To change how you view your forms, go to [your preferences page](../../user-accounts/edit_user_preferences) and do the following:

Scroll down to the section for *Single Project Tab Selection* and select either a custom or alphabetical view of your projects. Don't confuse this with the *Projects Page Tab Selection* section, which changes how all of your projects are organized within the *Projects* page.

## Alphabetical View

In the page for a single project, the alphabetical view will list your froms in order from a-z. After selecting another view, you can always go back to an alphabetical view by clicking **alphabetical** as shown below.

## Custom View

It is also possible to customize the order in which your forms are viewed. Follow these steps to create a custom view of your forms.

1. Make sure that you are in the **Custom** option on your project's page.

2. You may shift the placement of forms in your list by selecting the **up arrow** or **down arrow** to the left of each project's name.

3. Another option for moving projects is to click a project that you want to move and drag it to your desired location.

4. Whenever you open up to your custom view in the *Projects* page, the projects will automatically be shown in the order you have sorted it into.
