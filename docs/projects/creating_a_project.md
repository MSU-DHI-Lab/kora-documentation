#Creating a Project

A project is the biggest organizational structure in Kora. Each project is its own database, a container that houses all the information related to your individual or insitutional project. You can have multiple projects within your Kora instillation. A project can contain multiple forms customized for the types of data you would like to record. 

Follow the steps below to create a project.

1. From your projects list, click the **Create a New Project** button. This will bring you to the *New Project* page.

<br/> 
<br/>

<br/>

4. Now you have the option to choose project administrators other than yourself. As you are the creator of the project, you are automatically added as a project admin. A project admin has the ability to create, edit, and delete forms in the project. Click in the white box below **Select Project Admins** to search the list of users in your Kora installation. Choose the names of individuals you would like to add. You can add as many administrators as you would like at this time. You can also add users to your project after it is created. Visit the [Adding Users to Projects Guide](../projects/adding_users_to_projects.md) for more information.
