#Creating a Project

A project is the highest organizational level in a Kora installation. Each project is a discrete container that has its own forms, records, and users. A single Kora installation can have multiple projects, all of which can be administered and managed separately.

To create a project:

1. Click the **Create a New Project** button at the top of your Projects landing page. This will bring you to the *New Project* page. Alternatively, you can select **Create New Project** from the Project dropdown menu

2. On the *New Project* page, enter the name of the your project in the **Project Name** field. This is a required field.

3. Next, fill out the project description in the **Description** field. This is a required field, with a maximum of 1000 characters.

4. From here, you can select additional project administrators. As the creator of the project, you are automatically added as an admin. Open the **Select Project Admins** dropdown menu to view a list of all users associated with your Kora install. Select those users you would like to add as project admins (as many as you want). Alternatively, you can type a name into the field to find a particular user (this is helpful if your Kora install has a lot of users, and you don't want to scroll through a very long list of names to find the person you want). Remember, you can also add users to your project after it has been created. Visit the [Adding Users to Projects](../projects/adding_users_to_projects.md) documentation for more information.

5. After you have filled out the project name, project description, and selected any additional admins, click the **Create Project** button at the bottom of the page to create your project.
