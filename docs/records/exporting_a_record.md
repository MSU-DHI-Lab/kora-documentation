* The **Export Record Files** option downloads Kora records onto your computer as a zip file. It's important to note that this will only download files entered for a record such as images, documents, audio files, etc. Any records without digital files attached to it will not appear in the folder.

* The **Export JSON** file type downloads Kora records onto your computer as a JSON file. A JSON refers to the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format, which is a standard data interchange format. JSON files are text-based, machine-readable, and human-readable files that can be edited using a text editor. For more information on JSON file format, check out the [JSON Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON).

* The **Export XML** file type downloads Kora records onto your computer as an XML file. XML stands for  Extensible Markup Language (XML). This is a markup language which generates human-readable and machine readable text files. XML files emphasize simplicity and the description of data. For more information on XML files check out the [XML Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML).
