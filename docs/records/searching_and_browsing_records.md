# Searching and Browsing Records

The records in your digital repository are easily discoverable using Kora through several techniques. How you search for a record will depend on how narrow you want your search parameters to be. You can cast a wide net and search for a record across an entire Kora installation, or you can look in a specific project. There were also be many cases where you want to look at all of the records from a single form. This documentation will walk you through the steps of conducting each type of these searches.

## Searching Across a Kora Installation

At the navigation bar at the top of the page, is a **magnifying glass** icon. No matter what page you are on, this navigation bar and icon should be available. clicking on it will allow you to search for any records within the Kora Installation that you have access to. Follow these steps to search for a form using this method:

1. Click on the magnifying glass icon in the top right corner within the navigation bar. <p align="center"> <img src="../records-img/searching_and_browsing_records_1_annotated.png" width="100%" style="align:center" title="Step 1"> </p>

2. A search bar will appear which will allow you to enter search terms associated with the record you are searching for. <p align="center"> <img src="../records-img/searching_and_browsing_records_2_annotated.png" width="100%" style="align:center" title="Step 2"> </p>

3. If you are able to enter the KID of your record, the option to *Go to Record:* will be made available under the search bar. Simply click on the record number to go to that record.

## Searching for a Record within a Project

You can greatly narrow down the number of records you search through if you know what project a record may be in. You can select a project or projects to search through in the *Search Kora* page as mentioned in step 9 above. There is a way to search for specific records in a project from the project home page, however. Follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the project home that you want to search through and open either of the menus shown below in the navigation bar. <p align="center"> <img src="../records-img/searching_and_browsing_records_9_annotated.png" width="100%" style="align:center" title="Step 9"> </p> </p>

2. Select **Project Records Search** from the menu. <p align="center"> <img src="../records-img/searching_and_browsing_records_10_annotated.png" width="100%" style="align:center" title="Step 10"> </p> </p>

3. This will bring you to the *Project Records Search* page. You may search for a particular record using the *Search Via Keyword(s) or KID* search bar. <p align="center"> <img src="../records-img/searching_and_browsing_records_11_annotated.png" width="100%" style="align:center" title="Step 11"> </p> </p>

After locating your form, click on the name of your form to jump to that form. <p align="center"> <img src="../records-img/searching_and_browsing_records_15_annotated.png" width="100%" style="align:center" title="Step 15"> </p>

6. Another option for searching through form records is to perform an advanced search. <p align="center"> <img src="../records-img/searching_and_browsing_records_17_annotated.png" width="100%" style="align:center" title="Step 17"> </p>

## Form Records Advanced Search

Advanced searches can be conducted on form records to utilize specialized search tools that Kora offers. The advanced search option can be accessed from the *Form Records and Search* page as outlined in step 6 in the previous section, but it can also be accessed from the navigation bar. <p align="center"> <img src="../records-img/searching_and_browsing_records_18_annotated.png" width="100%" style="align:center" title="Step 18"> </p>

The options available for an advanced search will depend upon the fields that you have made advanced searchable while creating a field. You can [edit whether or not a field is advanced searchable](../forms/editing_fields.md) There are some standard options, however:

* An field that was made advanced searchable will display a space to enter a values on the advanced search page. Any records which match the values entered here in the corresponding field will match your search.

* **Alternative Field Name** - searches the alternative names of fields for your keywords.

* **Negative** - Can be checked in order to make records that do not fit your search be the results that show up instead.

* **empty** - returns results in which the fields for your keyword are empty. <p align="center"> <img src="../records-img/searching_and_browsing_records_1_annotated.png" width="100%" style="align:center" title="Step 19"> </p>
