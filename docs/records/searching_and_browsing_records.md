# Searching and Browsing Records

The records in your digital repository will undoubtably begin to grow to large numbers between [creating](../records/creating_a_record.md), [importing](../records/importing_a_record.md) and [batch ingesting](../records/batch_ingesting_records.md) of records you'll be doing. Searching for and browsing through records will become more necessary as the number of records grows over time. There are several ways to search for a record, that depend on how narrow your search parameters are. You are able to search for a record across an entire Kora installation, in a specific project and within a particular form. You may also browse all records from one form.

## Searching Across a Kora Installation

At the navigation bar at the top of the page, is a **magnifying glass** icon. No matter what page you are on, this navigation bar and icon should be available. clicking on it will allow you to search for any records within the Kora Installation that you have access to. Follow these steps to search for a form using this method:

1. Click on the magnifying glass icon in the top right corner within the navigation bar. <p align="center"> <img src="../forms-img/searching_for_a_form_1_annotated.png" width="100%" style="align:center" title="Step 1"> </p>

2. A search bar will appear which will allow you to enter keywords found within the record you are searching for. <p align="center"> <img src="../forms-img/searching_for_a_form_2_annotated.png" width="100%" style="align:center" title="Step 2"> </p>

3. If you are able to enter the KID of your record, the option to *Go to Record:* will be made available under the search bar. Simply click on the record number to go to that record. The record number must be entered exactly to bring up this option. <p align="center"> <img src="../forms-img/searching_for_a_form_3_annotated.png" width="100%" style="align:center" title="Step 3"> </p>

5. You may not know the exact KID of your record, however. In that case, you will have to enter keywords and data into the search bar that might be associated with that record and click the right-facing **arrow** in the search bar to perform a proper search. <p align="center"> <img src="../forms-img/searching_for_a_form_5_annotated.png" width="100%" style="align:center" title="Step 5"> </p>

6. This search will examine records, forms, fields and projects for any results which may match your search. Kora will then display these results on the *Search Kora* page. Any records matching your search will be found in the **Records()** tab for you to browse. <p align="center"> <img src="../forms-img/searching_for_a_form_6_annotated.png" width="100%" style="align:center" title="Step 6"> </p>

## Searching for a Record within a Project

You can greatly narrow down the number of records you search through if you know what project a record may be in. You can select a project or projects to search through in the *Search Kora* page as mentioned in step 9 above. There is a way to search for specific records in a project from the project home page, however. Follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the project home that you want to search through and open either of the menus shown below in the navigation bar. <p align="center"> <img src="../forms-img/searching_for_a_form_7_annotated.png" width="100%" style="align:center" title="Step 7"> </p>

2. Select **Project Records Search** from the menu. <p align="center"> <img src="../forms-img/searching_for_a_form_8_annotated.png" width="100%" style="align:center" title="Step 8"> </p>

3. This will bring you to the *Project Records Search* page. You may search for a particular record using the *Search Via Keyword(s) or KID* search bar. <p align="center"> <img src="../forms-img/searching_for_a_form_9_annotated.png" width="100%" style="align:center" title="Step 9"> </p>

7. Results can be expanded to read the details or collapsed to see more records on a single page.

The record search will automatically start off by searching through all forms, but it's possible to search through particular forms by selecting them from the *Search and Select Form(s) to Filter Results* box. <p align="center"> <img src="../forms-img/searching_for_a_form_9_annotated.png" width="100%" style="align:center" title="Step 9"> </p>

## Searching and Browsing Records in a Form

A form is where records are made. As such, all records for a particular form can be browsed from that form. It is also possible to navigate to a form and search for a particular record in that form.

1. From the project home page, you are able to navigate directly to the *Form Records and Search* page. <p align="center"> <img src="../forms-img/searching_for_a_form_10_annotated.png" width="100%" style="align:center" title="Step 10"> </p>

2. You may also get to the *Form Records and Search* page by through either the **Form Record & Search()** button Select **Jump to Form +** and scroll through the possible forms. After locating your form, click on the name of your form to jump to that form. <p align="center"> <img src="../forms-img/searching_for_a_form_11_annotated.png" width="100%" style="align:center" title="Step 11"> </p>

3. Here you may browse all records from a form or perform a search using the *Search Via Keyword(s) or KID* box at the top.

7. Results can be expanded to read the details or collapsed to see more records on a single page.  

4. Keywords can be filtered by selecting “Or”, “And”, or “KID”. <p align="center"> <img src="../forms-img/searching_for_a_form_9_annotated.png" width="100%" style="align:center" title="Step 9"> </p>

5. Another option for searching through form records is to perform an advanced search. <p align="center"> <img src="../forms-img/searching_for_a_form_9_annotated.png" width="100%" style="align:center" title="Step 9"> </p>

## Form Records Advanced Search

Advanced searches can be conducted on form records to utilize specialized search tools that Kora offers. The advanced search option can be accessed from the *Form Records and Search* page as outlined in step 6 in the previous section, but it can also be accessed from the navigation bar. <p align="center"> <img src="../forms-img/searching_for_a_form_9_annotated.png" width="100%" style="align:center" title="Step 9"> </p>

There are three types of advanced search in the context of Form Records:

* **rich text(alternative field name)** - searches the alternative names of fields for your keywords.

* **Negative** - Can be checked in order to make records that do not fit your search be the results that show up instead.

* **empty** - returns results in which the fields for your keyword are empty. <p align="center"> <img src="../forms-img/searching_for_a_form_9_annotated.png" width="100%" style="align:center" title="Step 9"> </p>
