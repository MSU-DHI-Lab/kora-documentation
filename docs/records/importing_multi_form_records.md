# Batch Ingesting Records

To get records into Kora, check out [the documentation on importing records](/records/importing_a_record.md)

Data ingestion is a process by which data is moved from one or more sources to a destination where it can be stored and further analyzed. The data might be in different formats and come from various sources, including RDBMS, other types of databases, S3 buckets, CSVs, or from streams. Since the data comes from different places, it needs to be cleansed and transformed in a way that allows you to analyze it together with data from other sources. Otherwise, your data is like a bunch of puzzle pieces that don't fit together.

Batch data is an efficient way of processing large volumes of data where a large set of transactions collect over time. Data is collected, entered, and processed and then batch results are produced with tools like Hadoop.

This batch ingestion stuff may be a bit too much for me. I am not sure how to do it in Kora.
