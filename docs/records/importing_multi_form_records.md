# Importing Multi Form Records
If you want to import your forms into more than one form, then you will have to format your records in a particular way. This is a slightly different process than [importing records into a single form](/records/importing_a_record.md), but it follows the same principles.

# Batch Ingesting Records

To get records into Kora, check out [the documentation on importing records](/records/importing_a_record.md)
(Taken from https://www.alooma.com/blog/what-is-data-ingestion)
Data ingestion is a process by which data is moved from one or more sources to a destination where it can be stored and further analyzed. The data might be in different formats and come from various sources, including RDBMS, other types of databases, S3 buckets, CSVs, or from streams. Since the data comes from different places, it needs to be cleansed and transformed in a way that allows you to analyze it together with data from other sources. Otherwise, your data is like a bunch of puzzle pieces that don't fit together.

Batch data is an efficient way of processing large volumes of data where a large set of transactions collect over time. Data is collected, entered, and processed and then batch results are produced with tools like Hadoop.

This batch ingestion stuff may be a bit too much for me. I am not sure how to do it in Kora.

## Navigating to the Import Page
Navigating to *Import Multi Form Records* page can take place from either the [dashboard](../projects/managing_projects_from_the_dashboard.md) or from a project's homepage.

* From the dashboard, you are able to navigate to the *Import Multi Form Records* page from a project block by clicking on the **Quick Action** icon. <p align="center"> <img src="../records-img/importing_multi_form_records_1_annotated.png" width="100%" style="align:center" title="Step 1"> </p>

* Alternatively, you may select **Import MF Record Setup** from the project homepage using the Kora menu. <p align="center"> <img src="../records-img/importing_multi_form_records_2_annotated.png" width="100%" style="align:center" title="Step 2"> </p>

Either of these options will bring you to the *Import Multi Form Records* page where you can import record files to multiple forms <p align="center"> <img src="../records-img/importing_multi_form_records_3_annotated.png" width="100%" style="align:center" title="Step 3"> </p>
