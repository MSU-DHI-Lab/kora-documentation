#Creating a Record
A **record** is the metadata element. A record is generated by entering information into fields within a form. 

Follow the steps below to create a record.

First, open your current project (You can find the list of your projects by clicking on the *Projects* button on the top menu). Choose the form you would like to enter a record for by clicking on the *form name*.

1. To create a record, you can either click the **Create New Record** button or you can click the form name in the menu bar to open the dropdown and choose the **Create New Record** option.
