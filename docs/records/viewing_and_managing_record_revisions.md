#Viewing and Managing Record Revisons
A [record](../records/creating_a_record.md))** is the metadata element. A record is generated by entering information into fields within a form. It is possible to edit previously created records, as well as keep track of each record revision. You may want to view and manage these record revisions, which is possible in a few short steps.  

1. First [go to the form](../forms/navigating_to_a_form.md) in which the record you wish to view resides. Click the **Form Records & Search** button. This will bring you to a page where you can view all records within that form.

2. You have two options on how to get to view and manage record revisions:

	a) Scroll and find the record you wish to review and click the **View Revisions** option at the bottom of the record box.

	b) Or you can click the name of the record. If you click the name of the record, it will bring you to the records page. At the top of this page, click the **View Revisions** option.

Either option will bring you to the **Record Revisions** page for that specific record. From here, you are able to view the edits that have been made to the record over its lifetime. Data about the day and time these edits where made as well as the users who made them is automatically  tracked.

Record revisions will display edits made to the record in the *Edits Made* section. What the record looked liked before the edits will be displayed in the *Before* section, allowing you to see what was changed at each revision point. You can sort the revisions by date and user using the text boxes at the top of the page.

##Restore Record to Before (aka to a Previous Version)

It is possible restore your record to a previous version. To do this, find the version you would like to return the record to, and click **Restore Field(s) to Before**.

<img style="display:block;margin:auto;max-width:100%" src="../records-img/viewing_and_managing_record_revisions_5_annotated.png" title="Restore Fields to Before">

A popup will appear asking if you would like to restore fields to before. Click the green button at the bottom of the page.

<img style="display:block;margin:auto;max-width:100%" src="../records-img/viewing_and_managing_record_revisions_6_annotated.png" title="Restore Fields to Before pop-up">

This will *Rollback* your record to the previous version selected and document this change in the *Record Revisions* page for that record.
