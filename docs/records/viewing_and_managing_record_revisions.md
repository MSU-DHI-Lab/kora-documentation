#Viewing and Managing Record Revisons
A **record** is the metadata element. A record is generated by entering information into fields within a form. It is possible to edit previously created records, as well as keep track of each record revision. You may want to view and manage these record revisions, which is possible in a few short steps.  

1. First go to the form in which your record you wish to view resides. Click the **Form Records & Search** button. This will bring you to a page where you can view all records within that form. ![open current project](/records-img/viewing_and_managing_record_revisions_1_annotated.png "Step 1")

2. You have two options on how to get to view and manage record revisions:

	a) Scroll and find the record you wish to review and click the **View Revisions** option at the bottom of the record box. ![open current project](/records-img/viewing_and_managing_record_revisions_2_annotated.png "Step 2a")

	b) Or you can click the name of the record. If you click the name of the record, it will bring you to the records page. At the top of this page, click the **View Revisions** option. ![open current project](/records-img/viewing_and_managing_record_revisions_3_annotated.png "Step 2b")

This will open the **Record Revisions** page for that specific record. Below you are able to view the edits made to the record in addition to information about when it was created. Data tracked about edits made to records include day, time, and user. You can sort the revisions by date and by user. Record revisions will show the *Before* and *Edits Made* so you are able to see what was changed at each revision point.

##Restore Record to Before (aka to a Previous Version)

It is possible restore your record to a previous version. To do this, find the version you would like to return the record to, and click **Restore Field(s) to Before**. 

![open current project](/records-img/viewing_and_managing_record_revisions_5_annotated.png "restore to previous version")

A popup will appear asking if you would like to restore fields to before. Click the green button at the bottom of the page. 

![open current project](/records-img/viewing_and_managing_record_revisions_6_annotated.png "restore to previous version")

This will *Rollback* your record to the previous version selected and document this change in the *Record Revisions* page for that record.
