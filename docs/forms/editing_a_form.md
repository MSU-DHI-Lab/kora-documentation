#Editing a Form
A **form** is the mechanism by which you are able to generate records. It is similar to a form that you would fill out to catalog an artifact or object. It can contain multiple pages and various input fields. A form will determine the types of metadata that is generated for a project. Each project can have multiple forms depending on the types of objects you are recording or who your target audience(s) are. 

You may want to edit a form you have previously created, either to change the name of the form, edit the description, make the form a preset, edit users and administrators of the form, or to delete the form. 

Follow the steps below to edit a form. 

1. Open your current project (You can find the list of your projects by clicking on the *Projects* button on the top menu). ![open current project](/forms-img/editing_a_form_1_annotated.png "Step 1")

2. Scroll and choose the form you would like to edit, then click the button **Edit Form Info**. ![open current project](/forms-img/editing_a_form_2_annotated.png "Step 2")

3. This will bring you to the *Edit Form* page. Here you can edit the **Form Name** and **Description**. You also have the option of setting this form as a **Preset**, which will allow you to apply this forms information and layout structure to a new form. ![open current project](/forms-img/editing_a_form_3_annotated.png "Step 3")

4. Here you also have the option of editing form permissions. This is where you can add new administrators and users to your form.
