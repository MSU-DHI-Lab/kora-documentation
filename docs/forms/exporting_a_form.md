#Exporting a Form

Exporting a form allows you to save the form as a .kForm file onto your computer. Another benefit of exporting a form is that it allows you to import that form into another Kora project, instead of having to recreate the form and its fields. 

Follow the steps below to export a form. 

1. Open the form you would like to export. Click the **form name** in the blue menu bar to open a dropdown menu. 

<p align="center"> <img src="../forms-img/creating_a_form_2_annotated.png" width="100%" style="align:center" title="Step 1"> </p>

2. At the bottom of this dropdown menu, click the **Export Form** option. 

<p align="center"> <img src="../forms-img/creating_a_form_2_annotated.png" width="100%" style="align:center" title="Step 2"> </p>

This will automatically download the form onto your computer as a .kForm file type. 

*Note*: If you wish to import this form into a different Kora project, visit the [Importing a Form Guide](../forms/importing_a_form.md).
