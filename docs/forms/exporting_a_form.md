#Exporting a Form

Exporting a form allows you to save the form as a .kForm file onto your computer. Another benefit of exporting a form is that it allows you to [import](../forms/importing_a_form.md) that form into another Kora [project](../projects/creating_a_project.md), instead of having to recreate the [form](../forms/creating_a_form.md) and its [fields](../forms/creating_fields.md).

Follow the steps below to export a form:

1. [Navigate to the form](../forms/navigating_to_a_form.md) you would like to export. Click the **Form Name** in the menu bar to open a dropdown menu.

    <img style="display:block;margin:auto;max-width:100%" src="../forms-img/export_a_form_1_annotated.png" width="100%" title="Click Your Form's Name in the Menu Bar">

2. At the bottom of this dropdown menu, click the **Export Form** option.

    <img style="display:block;margin:auto;max-width:100%" src="../forms-img/export_a_form_2_annotated.png" width="100%" title="Click Export Form">

This will automatically download the form onto your computer as a .kForm file type.
