# Adding Users to Forms
 Adding a user to a [form](content/creating_a_form.md) gives certain form permissions to [users already in your KORA organization](content/managing_users_in_a_kora_installation.md). Form permissions allow users to create, edit, and delete fields as well as records, depending on the permissions given to them. Limiting the amount of form permissions granted to a user is useful when you only want to allow that user to enter data and create records and not alter the fields that data is entered into.

## Adding Users to Forms
Before adding users to a form, you will have to [navigate to the project home page](content/navigating_to_a_form.md) and select the **edit form info** button.

The **edit form info** button will take you to the [Edit Form](content/navigating_to_a_form.md) page where you can press **Go to Form Permissions Page** to add additional users and adjust their permissions.
