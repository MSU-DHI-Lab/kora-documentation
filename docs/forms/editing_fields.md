# Editing Fields
A [form](content/creating_a_form.md) allows you to determine how data is entered into [KORA](content/understanding_core_concepts.md) as a record. In some instances you may want to split your data entry into multiple sections. For instance, you may want information about the dimensions of an object entered in one section and cultural information associated with that object in another. Separating [fields](content/creating_fields.md) into multiple pages allows you to organize your form with these concepts in mind.

## Editing Field options from the Form Page
You can open up a field by clicking anywhere on the field box, except for on the actual field name. Here you will see more options in the checkmarked boxes. You may also delete a field from here. 

## Editing Field Options in the Field Page
You can edit additional information about the field by clicking on the name of the field or the **field options** button.

Any field can be edited by:
1. Clicking on the name of the field or the **field options** button.
2. editing the options within the field page. There are three types of information that can be edited on the field page:
    * Basic field Information
      * You will be able to edit the field title, description, alternative text. You can edit these text by clicking on the text box and editing the text into your desired content.
    * Specific Field types
      * There will be different options for editing different types of fields. These will appear under the field description. For a more in depth understanding of the options for each specific field, check out the page on [understanding field types](content/understanding_field_types.md)
    * Standard Options
      * There are some options in every type of text field that will be the same. These are discussed here. A description of these options are found above, or in step 4 of [creating fields](content/creating_fields.md). These are options that you can also select on the form page.
3. Clicking the **update fields** button at the bottom of the page.
    * After you have finished your edits for the field, click on the **update field** button at the bottom of the page.
