# Creating a Multipage Form
A [form](content/creating_a_form.md) allows you to determine how data is entered into [KORA](content/understanding_core_concepts.md) as a record. In some instances you may want to split your data entry into multiple sections. For instance, you may want information about the dimensions of an object entered in one section and cultural information associated with that object in another. Separating [fields](content/creating_fields.md) into multiple pages allows you to organize your form with these concepts in mind.

Here we will talk about the particular options associated with creating each field. There are some options associated with the creation of every field, however. When creating or editing a field, you'll notice a dropdown menu that allows you to select the field type. There are a variety of field types that allow you to enter different data.

The default page will initially contain no [fields](content/creating_fields.md), but you may soon find yourself overwhelmed in an attempt to get the most amount of data possible. In many cases, it may be better for the readability of your form to separate these fields into multiple pages.

Follow these steps to create and organize new pages:
1. Below the default page, press the **Create New Form Page Here** button
![click the create new form page button](files/creating_a_multipage_form_2_annotated.png)
2. The first new page will appear below the default page, but you can add as many pages as you need for your data entry, including in between existing pages. A new Page will appear wherever you click to add a new page
