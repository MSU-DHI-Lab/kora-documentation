# Creating a Multipage Form
A [form](content/creating_a_form.md) allows you to determine how data is entered into [KORA](content/understanding_core_concepts.md) as a record. In some instances you may want to split your data entry into multiple sections. For instance, you may want information about the dimensions of an object entered in one section and cultural information associated with that object in another.

The default page will initially contain no [fields](content/creating_fields.md), but you may soon find yourself overwhelmed in an attempt to get the most amount of data possible. In many cases, it may be better for the readability of your form to separate these fields into multiple pages.

Follow these steps to create and organize new pages:
1. Below the default page, press the **Create New Form Page Here** button

2. The first new page will appear below the default page, but you can add as many pages as you need for your data entry, including in between existing pages. A new Page will appear wherever you click to add a new page

3. You may also reorganize where your pages appear by clicking on the **navigation arrow** in the top left corner of each page. Clicking on the top arrow will switch that page with the page above it, and the bottom arrow it will likewise switch the selected page with the page below it.

1. Click on the field you want to move.
