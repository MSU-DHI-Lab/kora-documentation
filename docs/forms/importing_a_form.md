#Importing a Form

Importing a form allows you to import a .kForm file from your computer into a Kora Project. Importing a form allows you to use a previously created form in a new or different project without having to recreate the form and its fields. 

Follow the steps below to import a form. 

1. Open the project you would like to import your form into. Click the project name in the blue menu bar to open the dropdown options. Click the **Import Form Setup** option. ![open current project](../forms-img/importing_a_form_2_annotated.png=250x "Step 1")

2. In **Import Form Setup**, either drag and drop your form file from you computer into the box or choose the **Select the Form File here** option to choose it through a file browser. ![open current project](../forms-img/importing_a_form_2_annotated.png=250x "Step 2")

3. Click the **Upload Form File** button. ![open current project](../forms-img/importing_a_form_3_annotated.png=250x "Step 3")

4. Under the *Form Information* section, you have the option to enter a form name and description, or you can leave these options blank to use the name and description from the original form. ![open current project](../forms-img/importing_a_form_4_annotated.png=250x "Step 4")

5. Press the **Import Form & Information** button. ![open current project](../forms-img/importing_a_form_5_annotated.png=250x "Step 5")

This will automatically upload the form into your project.
