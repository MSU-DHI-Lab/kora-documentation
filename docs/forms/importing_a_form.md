#Importing a Form

Importing a [form](../forms/creating_a_form.md) allows you to import a .kForm file from your computer into a Kora Project. You can obtain a .kform file from another project by [exporting a form](../forms/exporting_a_form.md). Importing a form allows you to use a previously created form in a new or different project without having to recreate the form and its [fields](../forms/creating_fields.md).

Follow the steps below to import a form:

1. Open the [project](../projects/creating_a_project.md) you would like to import your form into. From that project's page, click the project name in the menu bar to open the dropdown options. Click the **Import Form Setup** option.
