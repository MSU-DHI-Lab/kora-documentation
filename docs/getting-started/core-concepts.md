title: Understanding Core Concepts

Like many other digital repository, archive, and library platforms, Kora is designed which a specific kind of architecture.  This architecture determines both how projects using Kora are organized as well as the workflow used by those working on the projects.  

In the case of Kora, this architecture is somewhat hiearchical, which relevant moving parts nested within one another.  In order to get the most out of Kora, it is important to understand these components, what role they play, and how the interact with one another

### Kora Installation

A Kora installation can have any number of discreet projects (more on Projects below).  For the most part, each project in a Kora installation is its own silo.  The only exception to this is that from within the Kora installation, admins can search across multiple project (cross project searching).  In addition, the Kora API can be used to display (including searching and browsing) records from across multiple projects in one public website.  

While a Kora installation can contain any number of projects, you might also feel the need to install more than one instance of Kora on a server (to isolate one specific project in a container, for instance).  

To learn about what you need to install Kora on a server, check out [System Requirements](../getting-started/system_requirements.md).  If you are interested in installing Kora on Reclaim or Domain of One's Own, check out [Installing Kora on Domain of One's Own and Reclaim Hosting](../getting-started/installing_kora_domains.md)
